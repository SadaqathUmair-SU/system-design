## Advantages and Disadvantages of Microservices  

Microservices are a software architecture style where an application is developed as a set of small, independent services that communicate with each other over a network. Here are some advantages and disadvantages of using microservices:

**Advantages:**  

Scalability: Microservices are highly scalable, and you can add new services to your application without affecting the existing ones. Each service can be scaled independently based on the demand, which makes it easier to handle large workloads.

Flexibility: Since each service in a microservices architecture is independent, developers can choose different technologies and programming languages for each service. This allows for greater flexibility and enables you to use the best tool for each task.

Resilience: Microservices are designed to be resilient, and if one service fails, it does not affect the entire application. This makes it easier to recover from failures, and it also reduces the risk of downtime.

Continuous delivery: Microservices enable continuous delivery, which means you can deploy new features or functionality quickly without affecting the existing services. This allows you to deliver updates to your users faster and more frequently.

**Disadvantages:**

Complexity: Microservices can be more complex than monolithic services because of the increased number of components and the need to manage communication between them. This complexity can make it harder to develop, test, and deploy the application.

Integration testing: Integration testing can be more challenging with microservices because each service has its own data storage and communication protocol. This makes it harder to test the entire application as a whole, and it can lead to issues with data consistency and performance.

Distributed systems: Microservices are a distributed system, and this introduces new challenges related to security, network latency, and service discovery. It requires additional effort to maintain and monitor the health of all services.

In summary, microservices architecture offers scalability, flexibility, resilience, and continuous delivery, but it comes with challenges such as increased complexity, integration testing, and managing distributed systems. It's important to carefully consider the pros and cons of microservices before deciding whether it's the right architecture for your project.


## Patterns of decomposing the monolithic service to microservice OR creating a new microservice  

**Decomposition:**  
Decompose by business capabilities  
Decompose by subdomain(Domain Driven)  

**Database:**  
Individual database for each microservice  
Shared database for all microservices  

**Communication between the each microservices:**  
API's  
Events 

**User Interface Integration:**  
API gateways
